## Critical Issue
The `ProjectSummary` struct is missing the `Deserialize` derive, but it's used in structs that require deserialization.

## Solution

Find the `ProjectSummary` struct definition (likely in one of these locations):
- `shared/src/types.rs`
- `services/src/models.rs`
- Or wherever domain models are defined

```rust
// Current (WRONG):
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, schemars::JsonSchema)]
pub struct ProjectSummary {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,
}

// Should be (CORRECT):
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, schemars::JsonSchema)]
pub struct ProjectSummary {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,
}
```

## Why This Is Needed

The `TaskWithAttempt` struct (task_server.rs:290) uses `ProjectSummary` and has `Deserialize` derive:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, schemars::JsonSchema)]
pub struct TaskWithAttempt {
    pub project: ProjectSummary,  // ProjectSummary MUST have Deserialize!
    // ... other fields
}
```

## Verification
After fixing, run:
```bash
cargo build --release --bin mcp_task_server
```

All 8 tools are implemented - just need to add the missing derive!
